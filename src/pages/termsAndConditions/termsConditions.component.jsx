                                It is within our intentions to resolve any matter of concern or
                                dispute with our clients in an amicable manner. Hence, any
                                dispute, miscommunication will be initially addressed to your
                                personal client manager who will attempt to resolve it directly
                                with you. Any dispute that cannot be mutually resolved shall be
                                referred to an arbitrator that will be appointed by both
                                parties (us and you) in writing. If we still cannot reach an
                                agreement with you, the issue will be resolved before the
                                Courts in the Republic of Cyprus under the laws of the Republic
                                of Cyprus as governing law.
